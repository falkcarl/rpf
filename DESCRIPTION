Description: The purpose of this package is to factor out logic and math common
    to Item Response Theory fitting, diagnostics, and analysis. It is
    envisioned as core support code suitable for more specialized IRT packages
    to build upon. A version 1.0 will offer optimized, low-level functions to
    map parameters to response probabilities for a wide variety of dichotomous
    and polytomous item models.
